Robert C. Martin (aka Uncle Bob) wrote this in his wonderful blog article about [The Obligation of the Programmer](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/11/15/WeRuleTheWorld.html):

*“We programmers. We rule the world. We write the rules that make our society work.*

*Think about it; and think about it carefully. Nothing happens in our society without software. Nothing.*
*...With great power comes great responsibility. We, as programmers, should recognize that responsibility and determine to be conscientious servants of our society. We should set the limits and standards of our behavior.”*

We believe that. And that's why the Incus Data slogan is **CODING MATTERS**.

## GitHub for Course Material 

Many of the programmers on our courses use Github for their own projects. So it makes sense for us to make course material and coding examples available on GitHub as well.

This means that you can access the course material from anywhere and at any time. If you lose the original course material, examples or exercises, you can find it here easily.

The GitHub structure makes it easy for you to navigate and find what you need. We cover a **lot** of material in a 5-day course, and this is an easy way for you to find the right topic. And, of course, GitHub's search functionality will also save you time and effort when you are looking for something specific.

## Our Repositories (and Courses)

Over time, we plan to create a repository for almost every course we offer. As you can imagine, this will take a huge investment of time. And it will require continual updating.

In its initial stages, a repository will be private. When there is enough content to, hopefully, be of some value to you, we will make it public. That doesn't mean that it is complete. Course material - like software - is always a work in progress!:grinning: So please check back regularly.

You can find a [list of courses](https://incusdata.com/courses) on [our website](https://incusdata.com).

## For Everyone

We are happy to share our work with everyone - not just the delegates who come on our courses.

If you find something here useful, please **follow us on GitHub**. 

And if you have questions, comments or pick up an error, please submit a pull request. We appreciate your participation.
