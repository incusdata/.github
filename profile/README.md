# Incus Data: Training for Programmers

Robert C. Martin (aka Uncle Bob) wrote this in his wonderful blog article about [The Obligation of the Programmer](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/11/15/WeRuleTheWorld.html):

*We programmers. We rule the world. We write the rules that make our society work.*

*Think about it; and think about it carefully. Nothing happens in our society without software. Nothing.*
*...With great power comes great responsibility. We, as programmers, should recognize that responsibility and determine to be conscientious servants of our society. We should set the limits and standards of our behavior.*

We believe that. And that's why the Incus Data slogan is **CODING MATTERS**.
